## Virtual machine

Two versions of virtual machines are prepared for the course: vmware and Vagrant.
The link contains instructions for each option, as well as instructions for completing tasks on Windows:

## Tasks (exercises)

The exercises directory contains tasks with numbers corresponding to the sections of the book.
In addition, there are all auxiliary files (configurations, etc.) that are used in tasks.

> If you have tasks with letters (for example, 5.2a) in a section, it is better to do tasks without letters and then with letters. Tasks with letter tend to be slightly more complex than letter-free tasks and they develop or complicate the idea in the respective task without letter.
> For example, in the section there are tasks 5.1, 5.2, 5.2a, 5.2b, 5.3, 5.3a. First it is better to complete 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and then 5.2a, 5.2b, 5.3a
> If you can do a task with letters right away, it is better to do it in order.


## Tests

Starting from section "9. Functions" there are automatic tests for checking tasks. They help to check whether is everything done according to the task and also give feedback on what does not match the task. As a rule, after first period of adaptation to tests, it becomes easier to do tasks with tests.
